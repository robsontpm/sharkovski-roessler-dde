This is very very messy setup now. I will clean up it later.

For now, the protocol to generate data is as follows:

1. Check if every .cpp file has the same tau parameters. 
   Files to generate initial set should have eps = 0, otherwise, 
   it should have the same eps of your choice (not so big). 
2. Remove all files in ./bin, or move them to TRASH (in your subolder)
3. Recompile the project
4. Run ./Roessler_DDE_gencoords from inside ./bin
5. Modify GEN_JOBS.py to have the same CUT_Z, CUT_Y parameters as 
   you want them to be in your proof.
   From main folder run:
    
    python3 GEN_JOBS.py > JOBLIST.txt

6. Copy JOBLIST.txt to PREPLIST.txt,
   in PREPLIST.txt change
        Roessler_DDE_proof_piece
   to
        Roessler_DDE_prepPiece

7. Change NUM_JOBS in RUN_PREP.sh to your computer specs.
    Run 

        time bash RUN_PREP.sh | tee -a log_prep.txt

    after the program finishes, check log_prep.txt if it  does not contain any false. If not, it's good.

8. Run (this should be fast)
    
     bash MAKE_RUN_HULL.sh

   Then

      bash RUN_HULL.sh

9. Change NUM_JOBS in RUN_PROOF.sh to your computer specs.
    Run 

        time bash RUN_PROOF.sh | tee -a log_proof.txt

    after the program finishes, check log_proof.txt if it  does not contain any false. If not, it's good.
    The Theorem is proven.

    NOTE: you can comment some of the parts (esp. first one - its looong) to get results faster
    when testing.
